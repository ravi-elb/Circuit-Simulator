# Electronic Circuit Simulator
This project is an electronic circuit simulator that allows users to design and simulate electronic circuits. Users can add various components, connect them with wires, and run simulations to see the results. The simulator also provides options to save and load circuits, download simulation results as a PDF, and clear the circuit.

## Features
- Add various electronic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, voltage sources, current sources, ground, diodes, transistors, light bulbs, switches).
- Connect components with wires.
- Remove wire connections by clicking on them
- Run simulations to see the circuit summary and node analysis.
- Save and load circuits as JSON files.
- Download simulation results as a PDF.
- Clear the circuit.
- Undo and redo actions.
- 
### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
